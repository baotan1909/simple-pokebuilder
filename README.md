## About The Project

![Teambuilder Screenshot](assets/teambuilderScreenshot.png)

**Simple Pok√©mon Teambuilder** is a school project that allows you to form a simple Pok√©mon team. It is *simple* because:
- Supports **Generation 1 only**
- No moveset feature (yet)

However, despite that limitation, it includes:
- A public **Teams Gallery** where you can browse others‚Äô teams.
- Ability to **like** teams you admire.
